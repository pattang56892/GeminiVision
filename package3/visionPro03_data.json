            "content": "Yes, I have fully read all the code files you provided. I have processed and analyzed the code, including:\n\n*   **script.js:**  This is the primary frontend JavaScript file. It handles UI interactions, chat management, message display, API calls to the backend, tooltip creation, pinned chats, saving/loading chat data, text-to-speech, summarization, and much, much more.  It's the core logic of the web application.\n*   **app.py:** This is the backend Python file (likely a Flask application). It handles API requests for chat responses (using various LLMs like Gemini, Llama, Mistral, and others), summarization (using r.jina.ai), and file uploads (specifically PDFs).  It manages the logic for interacting with the different language models.\n*   **server.js:**  This is a Node.js backend (using Express) that serves as a data persistence layer.  It handles saving and loading chat data and tab data to/from JSON files. It provides a simple API for the frontend to store and retrieve its state.\n*   **AppDataManager.js:**  This JavaScript class acts as an intermediary between the frontend (`script.js`) and both the local storage (using `localStorage`) and the `server.js` backend. It manages the application's data, provides methods for accessing and modifying it, and synchronizes changes with both storage locations. It includes debouncing to prevent excessive saves.\n\nI understand the relationships between these files:\n\n1.  `script.js` uses `AppDataManager.js` to interact with data.\n2.  `AppDataManager.js` saves and loads data both locally (using `localStorage`) and remotely (using `server.js`).\n3.  `script.js` also makes direct API calls to `app.py` for language model interactions (chat, summarization, PDF processing).\n4. `app.py` handles the complex language model integrations and file processing.\n5. `server.js` provides a persistance layer.\n\nI am ready for your questions. I will do my best to answer them accurately and comprehensively based on my understanding of the code. Ask away!\n"

While the code might be conceptually divided into different sections (helper functions, UI setup, event handlers, etc.), and it *uses* an external module (`AppDatamanager`), it's all presented as one continuous block of JavaScript code. The presence of comments like \"// MAIN CHAT LOGIC\", \"// MESSAGE SENDING & DISPLAY\", and \"// HELPER FUNCTIONS\" confirms the code within a large, single-file script. There's no indication of separate, compiled, or linked modules, which you would generally have in a two or three codebase. This code uses module-based concept but it is contained in a single file script.\n"

I can analyze, understand, and answer questions about the code, but I cannot \"see\" or \"differentiate\" images within it because there are none.  I am a text-based model and do not have the capability to process visual information.\n\nTo proceed with your queries, you'll need to describe the *content* or *functionality* related to the \"uploads01\", \"uploads02\", and \"uploads03\" that you expect to find *within the JavaScript code*.  For instance, you could ask:\n\n*   \"Is there any code that references arrays or variables named `uploads01`, `uploads02`, or `uploads03`? If so, what does that code do?\"\n*   \"I believe there are image URLs stored in the code. Can you find arrays that likely contain image URLs, and tell me how many URLs are in each?\"\n*   \"Is there a function that deals with uploading files, and does it categorize uploads in any way?\"\n*   \"Can you find the code related to the avatar images, and tell me if they are grouped or categorized?\"\n\nBy providing textual descriptions or code-related questions, I can help you understand how the JavaScript handles what you *believe* to be image data.

It is organized to some degree by function.\n"
