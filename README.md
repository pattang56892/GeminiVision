# GeminiVision

Core Functionality:

Image Input Flexibility: The API can handle images from various sources: local files on your computer, URLs pointing to online images, and even image data encoded in Base64 format. This gives you a lot of flexibility in how you provide images for analysis.
Prompt-Driven Analysis: Just like with text-based models, you use prompts (questions or instructions) to guide the API’s analysis of the image. This means you can ask for specific information or focus on particular aspects of the image.
Text-Based Responses: The API doesn’t give you back an image. Instead, it provides a text-based response describing its understanding of the image and answering your prompt.
Specific Capabilities to Explore:

Image Description: Ask the API to give a general description of the image. This is a good starting point to see how well it can understand the overall scene.
Object Recognition: Try asking the API to identify specific objects within the image. This can be helpful for things like identifying items in a photo, or recognizing products.
Text Extraction (OCR): See how well the API can extract text from images, which could be text on signs, documents, or anything else embedded in the visual.
Contextual Understanding: Go beyond basic object recognition and see if the API understands the relationships between objects and the overall context of the scene. For example, can it tell that someone is standing next to a car?
Visual Reasoning: Test the API’s ability to reason about the visual information. For example, ask it questions about colors, positions, or actions taking place in the image.
Image Understanding Tasks: Explore how you can use the API for common tasks like classifying an image into categories, generating captions for images, or answering questions based on the content of the image.
Key Experiments:

Varied Prompts: Play with different phrasing and levels of detail in your prompts to see how it impacts the API’s responses. You can explore how the API can interpret vague and very specific queries.
Diverse Images: Try providing different types of images: images with varying complexity (simple vs. cluttered scenes), images with different lighting conditions, and images with diverse content.
Combining Text and Images: Explore the power of providing context to the image using text prompts to get very specific results.
Error Handling: Check how the API handles unclear images or situations where it might not be able to provide a good response.
In short, focus on using the Gemini API’s vision capabilities to understand the following:

What objects are present in the image?
What’s the overall scene depicted?
Can it extract text within the image?
Can it reason about the spatial relationship between items?
Can it answer specific questions about the content?
