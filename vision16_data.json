      "content": "Okay, let's break down this Python code step-by-step. It looks like a web scraper using the `scrapy` library, designed to extract information from Google search results and save it to JSON files.\n\n**Overall Purpose**\n\nThe script's main goal is to:\n\n1.  **Perform Google Searches:** Take a search query (likely provided through environment variables).\n2.  **Extract Data:** From the search results, extract relevant information like URLs, titles, and text snippets.\n3.  **Save to JSON:** Store the extracted data in a structured JSON format in separate files, each corresponding to a Google search.\n\n**Code Breakdown**\n\nLet's go through the code, section by section:\n\n**1. Imports and Setup**\n\n```python\nimport scrapy\nimport os\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport json\n```\n\n*   `scrapy`: The main web scraping framework used for handling requests, responses, and data extraction.\n*   `os`: Provides a way to interact with the operating system, like dealing with file paths.\n*   `dotenv`: Used for loading environment variables from a `.env` file.\n*   `json`: For working with JSON data (encoding and decoding).\n\n**2. Environment Variables and Debugging**\n\n```python\nenv_path = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), \"..\", \".env\"))\nload_dotenv(dotenv_path=env_path)\n\nprint(f\"[DEBUG]: .env loaded from: {env_path}\")\nprint(f\"[DEBUG]: GOOGLE_API_KEY is loaded: {'True' if os.getenv('GOOGLE_API_KEY') else 'False'}\") # Check if key is loaded\n```\n\n*   **`env_path`**: Calculates the absolute path to the `.env` file (presumably located in a parent directory).\n*   **`load_dotenv(dotenv_path=env_path)`**: Loads the environment variables from the specified `.env` file, making them accessible using `os.getenv()`.\n*   **`print(...)`**: Prints debug messages, confirming the loading of environment variables and the presence of the `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.\n\n**3. `DynamicSpider` Class**\n\nThis is where the spider logic resides, inheriting from `scrapy.Spider`.\n\n```python\nclass DynamicSpider(scrapy.Spider):\n    name = \"dynamic_spider\"\n    allowed_domains = [\"google.com\"] # Limit spider to Google\n```\n\n*   **`name`**: The spider's unique identifier.\n*   **`allowed_domains`**: Restricts the crawling to the specified domain (`google.com`).\n\n**4. `start_requests()` Method**\n\nThis method is called by Scrapy to initiate the crawling process.\n\n```python\n    def start_requests(self):\n        # Get data from .env file\n        google_api_key = os.getenv(\"GOOGLE_API_KEY\") # Get API Key from .env\n        search_query = os.getenv(\"SEARCH_QUERY\") # Get Actual Search Query (CSE) ID\n\n        if not google_api_key:\n            self.logger.error(\"GOOGLE_API_KEY is missing! check your .env file.\")\n            return\n        \n        self.logger.info(f\"\ud83d\udd11 Performing Google Search for: {search_query}\")\n        search_url = f\"https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1?q={search_query.replace(' ', '+')}&key={google_api_key}\" # Google API URL\n        headers = {\n                \"User-Agent\": \"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/119.0.0.0 Safari/537.36\"\n            } \n```\n\n*   Retrieves the Google API key and search query from environment variables.\n*   Error check if the API key is not available.\n*   Constructs the Google Custom Search API URL. Notice the `replace(' ', '+')` converts spaces to `+` for URL compatibility and also adds the API key.\n*   Sets up a User-Agent header, making it look like a request from a standard browser. This is best practice to avoid being blocked by servers.\n\n```python\n        try:\n            response = scrapy.Request(url=search_url, headers=headers, callback=self.parse_search)\n            return [response]\n        except Exception as e:\n            self.logger.error(f\"Google Search API request failed: {e}\")\n            return\n```\n\n*   Creates a `scrapy.Request` object to fetch the URL with specified headers.\n*   `callback=self.parse_search` tells Scrapy to call the `parse_search` method after the request is processed\n*   Handles potential errors during the request using a `try-except` block.\n*   Returns a list of the requests to be processed.\n\n**5. `parse_search()` Method**\n\nThis method processes the response from the Google API search.\n\n```python\n    def parse_search(self, response):\n        if response.status != 200:\n            self.logger.error(f\"Google API request failed with status code: {response.status}\")\n            return\n\n        results = response.json()\n        links = [item['link'] for item in results.get(\"items\", [])][:5] # Extract first 5 links\n        if not links:\n            self.logger.error(\"\u26d4 No links found in search results. Check API key, CSE ID, or query.\")\n            return\n        self.logger.info(f\"\ud83d\udd17 Extracted links: {links}\")\n\n        for link in links:\n           yield scrapy.Request(url=link, callback=self.parse_article, headers=headers)\n```\n\n*   Checks the HTTP status code of the response (should be 200).\n*   Parses the JSON response to extract a list of URLs from the `items` array and limits it to the first 5 results.\n*   Handles the case of empty or invalid `items` array in the JSON.\n*   Logs the extracted links.\n*   For each link, creates another `scrapy.Request` to fetch the individual article page and assigns it to the `parse_article()` method.\n\n**6. `parse_article()` Method**\n\nThis method processes the individual article page and extracts content.\n\n```python\n    def parse_article(self, response):\n        raw_content = response.xpath('//body//text()').getall() # Extract full visible text\n        content = \" \".join(raw_content).strip() # Remove multiple spaces/newlines with a single space\n        \n        if not content:\n            self.logger.warning(f\"\u26a0\ufe0f No meaningful content extracted from {response.url}\")\n        \n        extracted_data = {\n           \"url\": response.url,\n           \"title\": response.xpath('//title/text()').get() if response.xpath('//title/text()').get() else \"No Title\",\n           \"content\": content[:1000] if content else \"No Content\" # Limit to 1000 chars for readability\n        }\n\n        yield self.save_to_json(extracted_data)\n```\n\n*   Extracts all text content from the `<body>` tag using XPath.\n*   Joins all extracted texts with spaces and removes leading/trailing whitespace.\n*   Checks if content is available.\n*   Extracts the title of the webpage using XPath, or assigns \"No Title\" if the title is missing\n*   Creates a dictionary called `extracted_data` to store extracted information (URL, title, content). It limits the content to the first 1000 characters for readability.\n*   Calls the `save_to_json` method to save the extracted data and yields it.\n\n**7. `save_to_json()` Method**\n\nThis method handles saving extracted data into JSON files.\n\n```python\n    def save_to_json(self, data):\n        file_name = data[\"url\"].replace(\"/\", \"_\").replace(\":\", \"_\") + \".json\"\n        file_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), \"results\", file_name)\n        \n        try:\n            # Check if the file is valid JSON\n            if os.path.exists(file_path):\n                with open(file_path, \"r\", encoding=\"utf-8\") as f:\n                    try:\n                        existing_data = json.load(f)\n                    except json.JSONDecodeError:\n                        self.logger.error(f\"\u26a0\ufe0f Corrupt JSON detected. Resetting file.\")\n                        existing_data = [] # Reset if JSON is corrupted\n            else:\n                existing_data = []\n\n            existing_data.append(data)\n            # Write back to file\n            with open(file_path, \"w\", encoding=\"utf-8\") as f:\n                json.dump(existing_data, f, ensure_ascii=False, indent=4)\n            return data\n        except Exception as e:\n            self.logger.error(f\"\u26d4 Error writing to JSON file: {e}\")\n```\n\n*   Generates a filename by converting the URL to a safe filename.\n*   Constructs the full file path for where the JSON file will be saved (`results` directory within the script's directory).\n*   Checks if the file already exists, if so it attempts to read it and appends to it and also handles errors if a JSONDecodeError occurs in the process and resets the file\n*   Opens the file in write mode (`\"w\"`), writes the data as pretty-printed JSON, and includes the new data in the file while ensuring compatibility with various characters. `ensure_ascii=False` allows the saving of non-ascii characters.\n*   Returns the extracted `data` to be yieldable\n*   Handles potential errors during file writing with a `try-except` block and logs any errors.\n\n**Explanation of Output and How It's Saved**\n\n*   **Output:**\n    *   The code generates a separate JSON file for each article URL. Each JSON file contains a single JSON list with a dictionary object including a \"url\", \"title\" and the extracted \"content\" field. The \"content\" field is limited to 1000 chars for better readability. The file names are created based on the URL they are obtained from by replacing unsafe characters.\n    *   The files will be saved into a directory named \"results\" within the current script directory, for every run of the script.\n*   **Saving Process:**\n    1.  **File Name Creation:** The URL of each scraped page is sanitized and used to create a unique file name with a `.json` extension.\n    2.  **Directory Check:** The code creates a subdirectory called `results` under the main directory to store the output, if it does not exist already.\n    3.  **JSON Write:** The code opens the corresponding json file and converts the dictionary to a JSON string and uses the `json.dump` function to output it to a formatted, readable json format. If the file already exists then it will append the new data to the JSON list inside that file.\n    4.  **Error Handling:** The code uses `try-except` blocks to handle potential issues with JSON encoding and writing to the files.\n\n**Why This Code Is Structured This Way**\n\n*   **Scrapy Framework:** The code uses Scrapy for its robust handling of web requests, parallel processing, and structured data extraction.\n*   **Modularity:** The code is well-organized with different methods for different tasks:\n    *   `start_requests` for initiating the process.\n    *   `parse_search` for extracting search result links.\n    *   `parse_article` for extracting content from individual pages.\n    *   `save_to_json` for handling file operations.\n*   **Environment Variables:** Using `.env` files keeps sensitive information like API keys separate from the codebase and makes it more configurable.\n*   **Logging:** Scrapy logging is used for tracking the progress and debugging of the script, highlighting critical information and warnings.\n*   **Robustness:**  Error handling using `try-except` makes the script more resilient to errors in requests and file operations. It also handles broken JSON formats.\n*   **Rate Limiting** By extracting only the first 5 links, the code has some form of rate limiting, however, if this were to be implemented more robustly, the `settings.py` of Scrapy and an extension to handle throttling would be better implemented for a more robust solution.\n*   **Readability**: The usage of code comments and spacing make the code much easier to understand.\n\n**In Summary**\n\nThis Python code is a well-structured web scraper that uses the Scrapy framework to extract data from Google search results and individual web pages. It saves the extracted data in JSON format in individual files, one for each scraped page. It also implements the use of environment variables, thorough logging, and good coding practices for a solid end-to-end scraping solution.\n"
